- 👋 Hi, I’m @chenzituo, a master student of MIT, MechE. Just starting my journey in science!
- Looking for a topic for the research life here right now! My ingredients include: combustion chemistry, CFD, scientific machine learning, stochastic process, dynamical systems ... My interests lie in: heterogeneous flow, reactive-transport coupling, biological reactive flow and electrochemical reactive flow. Heavily used Py nin the past, seriously considering re-pick C++ for extensive solvers; yet the comprehensiveness of my intended research would definitely have ML for approximation towards the nature.

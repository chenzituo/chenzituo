- 👋 Hi, I’m @chenzituo, a senior undergraduate in CCE, Tsinghua Univ. Just starting my journey in science!
- 👀 I’m interested in neural ODEs and detonation; right now searching for chance to integrate data science into physics!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning transformations, reinforce learning and detonation physics!
- 💞️ I’m looking to learning new exciting things here, and one day I'll devote myself to the community!

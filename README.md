- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chenzituo, a master student of MIT, MechE. Just starting my journey in science!
- Focusing on the carbon nanotube(CNT) research. My ingredients include: chemical kinetics, CFD, scientific machine learning, dynamical systems. Learning physics and computational chemistry this summer. Boom!
- Guess what, I am doing experiment now.
- Heavily used Python in the past, seriously considering re-pick C++ for extensive solvers; yet the comprehensiveness of my intended research would definitely have ML towards the scientific world.
